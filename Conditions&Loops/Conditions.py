# # Task 1- Driving age
# # - Declare a variable and assign it the value of the legal driving age in the United States.
# # - Declare a variable to store a user's age. Use the built-in Python input()
# # function to retrieve the user’s age via user input.
# # - If the user’s age is greater than or equal to the legal driving age in the United 
# # States, then print to the console “You are legally able to drive.”
# # - If the user’s age is less than the legal driving age in the United States, print to
# # the console “You are not old enough to drive yet.”

# age = 17

# age = input("What is your age?")
# print(input)

# if age >= "17":
#     print("You are legally able to drive.")

# else:
#     print("You are not old enough to drive yet.")

# # Task 2- Random number
# #     - Declare a variable to store a random number between 0 and 10. You will need
# #     to do some research to determine how to generate a random number in 
# #     Python.
# #         * A good search term to use: “random number Python”
# #     - If the number is between 0 and 2, print to the console “0 or 1 or 2”
# #     - If the number is between 3 and 5, print to the console “3 or 4 or 5”
# #     - If the number is between 6 and 8, print to the console “6 or 7 or 8”
# #     - If the number is equal to 9 or 10, print to the console “9 or 10” 

# import random
# number = random.randint (0,10)
# print(number)

# if number == 0 or number == 1 or number == 2:
#     print("0 or 1 or 2 ")

# if number == 3 or number == 4 or number== 5:
#     print("3 or 4 or 5")

# if number == 6 or number == 7 or number == 8:
#     print("6 or 7 or 8")

# else:
#     print('9 or 10')
